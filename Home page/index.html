                            In the world of exotic supercars, few are as strikingly styled or comfortable to drive as the Aston Martin DBS. Powered by a massive twin-turbo V12 engine, it produces an impressive 715 hp, making it one of the most potent cars ever produced by the fabled brand. Behind its sleek exterior and unbridled power, the DBS has a hand-crafted cabin that is modern and packed with tech. Some driver-assistance features are absent, and top rivals provide more cutting-edge gadgetry. But the DBS coddles passengers in high-end materials, with bespoke color schemes available from Aston Martin’s Q design department. Though it may not have as sharp of handling as some supercars, the DBS is hard to match as a long-distance driver.</div>

                                With head-turning good looks and more performance than you'll ever need, the Maserati MC20 is absolutely what you'd expect from a sleek Italian supercar. Sitting just behind the passenger compartment is a 621-horsepower twin-turbo V6 that provides seat-pinning performance. Precise handling and a lightweight carbon-fiber frame make the MC20 feel like a street-friendly F1 car. It's comfortable to drive — another point in its favor over a racecar —and Maserati even offers a few driver-assistance systems. Those features are optional, so if you don't want any electronic aids taking away from the purity of the experience, you can skip them. The all-new MC20 has quickly established a reputation as one of the most desirable cars in its class. Supply is limited, but this makes the Italian treat even more irresistible.</div>

                                The Aston Martin DB11 is a two-door coupe and convertible that's as comfortable doing laps at the raceway as it is pulling up to elegant black-tie events.

                                McLaren has gone to great lengths to differentiate the GT from its race-tuned cars with its smoother suspension and focus on comfort and convenience.

                                Cut from the same cloth as Lamborghinis going back decades, the Huracan is as unapologetic as it is astonishingly capable. The two-seat supercar is quicker than nearly anything on the road, yet it's still comfortable and tech-savvy enough to be driven daily. </div>

The Nissan GT-R is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the NISMO, which starts at $217,635 and comes with a 3.8L V6 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive.

                            The Lamborghini Aventador is one of the most exciting, exclusive, and expensive cars on the road, a V12-powered Italian exotic with astonishing performance and iconic styling. Its high price and impracticality take it off most shoppers' lists, but the Aventador is a top pick for the well-heeled enthusiast looking for a supercar that is as fun to drive as it is to behold. The Lamborghini Aventador is a 2-seater vehicle that comes in 1 trim levels. The most popular style is the SVJ Coupe, which starts at $518,695 and comes with a 6.5L V12 engine and All Wheel Drive.

                            Overview
                            The McLaren Artura supercar harnesses plug-in hybrid propulsion to deliver almost unparalleled performance. Some exotics out there are more practical daily drivers, yet few can match the drama of the Artura's swing-up doors and electrifying acceleration. The McLaren Artura is a 2-seater vehicle that comes in 4 trim levels. The most popular style is the TechLux Coupe, which starts at $246,900 and comes with a Plug-In Hybrid 3.0L V6 Turbo engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This Artura is estimated to deliver 18 MPG combined.
                            
                            Overall Assessment
                            McLaren was a racing company long before it built any cars for customers, and that dedication to craft shows everywhere in the 2023 McLaren Artura. From its aerodynamic exterior to the no-nonsense cabin styling, it's clear the Artura didn't show up to the same sculpting classes as Ferrari or Lamborghini. Instead, McLaren's brainpower went into delivering the most memorable driving experience this side of an F1 car. Crafted from a carbon-fiber tub and stocked with cutting-edge driving tech, the Artura's 671-hp engine and handling characteristics are configurable, and there's a healthy kick of electricity lurking within the rechargeable 7.4-kWh battery pack. The 11-mile EV range isn't going to conquer any interstates, but then that's not what the Artura is built to do. It's a precise instrument built for track work or exceptionally windy roads. The Ferrari 296 GTB and Porsche 911 Turbo are slightly quicker in a straight line, but few cars can provide the kind of distilled driving experience offered by the Artura. </div>
